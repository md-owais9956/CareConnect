## 🏥 What is CareConnect?

CareConnect is a system designed to **store and manage** data of doctors and patients, and **assign patients** to appropriate doctors.  
It is **not a chatbot** — it does not attempt natural-language conversations or diagnosis. Instead, it focuses on data management and matching.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Doctor Management** – Add, edit, and view doctor profiles (specialty, contact, availability, etc.)  
- **Patient Management** – Add, edit, and view patient profiles (details, medical history, etc.)  
- **Assignment Logic** – Automatically assign patients to suitable doctors (based on specialty, load balancing, etc.)  
- **Secure Storage** – Persist doctor & patient data reliably (e.g. via database)  
- **Simple UI / Dashboard** – Interface for administrators to manage assignments and records

## ⚙ Tech Stack

- Backend: Python (Flask)  
- Frontend: HTML / CSS / (optionally a frontend framework)  
- Data Storage: (you can mention your choice: SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)  
- Templates: Jinja (Flask templating)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/md-owais9956/CareConnect.git
cd CareConnect
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure your environment
Set up required environment variables (e.g. database URL, secret key) in instance/ or via your system environment.

4. Run the server
bash
Copy code
python app.py
5. Access the app
Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000

🧩 How It Works (High-Level)
Admin or user adds doctor entries (specialties, available slots, etc.).

Admin or user adds patient entries (basic info, history).

The system’s assignment module matches patients to doctors (you can define criteria: specialty match, availability, current load, etc.).

Assignments are stored and can be viewed, edited, or re-assigned as needed.

All entities are stored securely in the database for persistent record keeping.

✅ Limitations & Future Additions
Does not have chatbot, symptom parsing, or diagnosis functionality

Does not provide automated medical advice

Future features you might add:

Enhanced matching algorithms (geographic, urgency, etc.)

Notifications / reminders

More robust front-end (React, Vue, etc.)

Role-based access (admin, doctor, patient)

Audit logs, security enhancements
